About
The Personal Financial Assistant is a full-stack application that simplifies personal finance management. Users can log income and expenses, categorize transactions, visualize spending habits through graphs, and extract expense data from uploaded receipts (images or PDFs). The application follows a clean separation of concerns, with a frontend web app communicating with a backend via RESTful APIs, and data persisted in a database for reliability and scalability.
This project showcases modern software engineering practices, including clean code, modularity, robust error handling, and comprehensive documentation, making it a robust portfolio piece for software engineers.
Features

Transaction Logging: Create and categorize income and expense entries through an intuitive web interface.
Transaction Listing: View a list of income and expenses within a specified time range.
Data Visualization: Generate graphs to analyze expenses by category, date, or other metrics.
Receipt Extraction: Upload receipts (images or PDFs) to automatically extract and log expense data.

Bonus Features

Transaction History Import: Upload transaction history from tabular PDFs for bulk import.
Pagination: Support paginated API responses for listing transactions, improving performance for large datasets.
Multi-User Support: Allow multiple users to register and manage their finances independently.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs.
Database: PostgreSQL for persistent storage of user and transaction data.
Receipt Processing: Tesseract.js (for image OCR) and pdf2json (for PDF parsing) for expense extraction.
Other Tools:
Axios for API calls from the frontend.
Chart.js for data visualization.
Multer for file uploads.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication (multi-user support).
ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.



Data Model
The application uses a relational data model in PostgreSQL to ensure data integrity and efficient querying. Key tables include:

Users (for multi-user support):

user_id (Primary Key, UUID)
username (String, Unique)
email (String, Unique)
password_hash (String)
created_at (Timestamp)


Transactions:

transaction_id (Primary Key, UUID)
user_id (Foreign Key, references Users)
amount (Decimal)
category (String, e.g., "Groceries", "Salary")
type (Enum: "Income", "Expense")
date (Date)
description (String, Optional)
created_at (Timestamp)


Categories (for customizable categories):

category_id (Primary Key, UUID)
user_id (Foreign Key, references Users, allows custom categories per user)
name (String, e.g., "Utilities")
type (Enum: "Income", "Expense")



This model supports efficient querying for transaction listings, filtering by date range, and generating visualizations by category or date.
